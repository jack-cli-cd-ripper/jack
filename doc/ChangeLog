	is good. In a quick listening test with a difficult CD I could not
	spot any obvious flaws. Ogg Vorbis is impressive.

	time ;-)

2001-11-12 06:36  zarne

	* jack: 
	- small code cleanup (the category chooser is one function now
	instead of 3 instances)
	
	- freedb category is now remembered, useful for submitting updated
	entries
	
	- bug fixed: entering "0" as category used last category instead of
	aborting

2001-11-09 19:34  zarne

	* jack: 
	- added option --wait (wait on quit)
	
	- added option --workdir (where to put files / dirs, == base_dir)
	
	- added option --search (where to search for workdir, appends to
	searchdirs)
	
	- create all dirs leading to workdir

2001-11-08 19:57  zarne

	* jack: 
	This patch - provided by Martin Michlmayr - does this:
	
	- use float and int instead of atof and atoi.  The latter are
	deprecated (see Python documentation). (The jack_*.py modules need
	to be overhauled likewise)
	
	- Check if an input string is really an integer and don't fail if
	it's not.
	
	- Check the range of tracks in the -t arguments and ignore invalid
	tracks.

2001-11-08 02:22  zarne

	- ChangeLog will contain the more recent changes now, CHANGELOG the
	very old ones. ChangeLog will NOT be up-to date in cvs BUT in
	releases.

2001-11-07 18:43  zarne

	* doc/CHANGELOG: - prepared it for automatic actualization,
	released versions contain the CVS log from now on. CHANGELOG is now
	a template from which ChangeLog is generated when releasing, CVS
	will contain both in a undefined state.

2001-11-07 18:08  zarne

	- works with python2 now, I tested/use 2.1.1

	problems.

	- removed version info from doc/INSTALL because I keep to forget to
	update it

2001-10-10 23:21  zarne

	* jack: - changed http Submit-Mode from test to submit (oops)

	(Bender, you really should not program when you're sober!)

2001-10-06 00:14  zarne

	* bumped version to 2.9.5

	* lots of changes, fixes -- I lost track

2001-03-14 07:32  zarne

	* jack_mp3.py: Why hasn't this been in CVS before??? :]
	
	- huge performance gain
	
	- better (more accurate) frame syncing (two consecutive rames are
	searched for now)
	
	- more robust now
	
	- VBR bitrates are now returned as a float
	
	- preliminary ID3v2 support (corrently only the version number is
	extracted and the tag is skipped)
	
	- new info: bpf and framesize
	
	- better detection of Xing tags

2001-03-14 07:23  zarne

	- replaced tabs by spaces
	
	- this is not a official version now, I will sync this with
	official 1.0 soon.

2001-03-14 07:19  zarne

	* README, jack, doc/INSTALL: - support for freedb files which have
	track title or artist stored in the EXTT fields
	
	- toc reading for cdparanois disabled because it's incomplete for
	CD EXTRA
	
	- added support for CDDB.py, available at

	is now the default

	name
	
	- added support for EXDD=YEAR:	ID3G, who can tell me who set this
	"standard"?

	tokens
	
	- -G none now sets the ID3v1 genre to 255("unknown")
	
	- print year and genre when finished (if available)

2000-11-21 02:47  zarne

	* jack: *** .jackrc option to disable http_proxy *** replace x -> ×
	for speed factors *** sys.stdin.flush() removed, impossible :-).
	What's the "correct" way to flush stdin? fcntl with O_NONBLOCK,
	then reading (and discarding) until nothing is read? Is there an
	easy way? *** jack.freedb now has as many spaces in front of the
	MSF offsets as your favorite CD player *** some reformatting

2000-11-02 20:27  zarne

	* jack: 1) reformatted helpers{} 2) show_time = 1 and show_names =
	1 are now defaults 3) it's now called 2.99.4 (actually since the
	last commit)

2000-11-02 02:08  zarne

	* jack: 1) renamed id -> cd_id; id is a reserved word in python. 
	2) ignore data tracks, tested with cdparanoia only 3) quit if there
	are no audio tracks (to do) 4) --abort-on-skip is now the default
	for cdparanoia, change it if you    don't like it 5) call it 2.99.4
	
	cosmetic changes: 1) more straighforward displays 2) show_time now
	saves space by reducing track_names to their number.	 Thus the
	"normal" line for a track fits into 80 columns again.  3) Show
	freedb-id and total playing time in Options line 4) try to show
	Options line when exiting
	
	"do only one change per commit" is for sissies :-).

2000-08-13 20:16  zarne

	* jack: forgot this one in the previous commit

2000-08-13 20:13  zarne

	* jack: added a check for an existing destination directory

2000-08-11 00:02  zarne

	* jack: changed the short option for --update-freedb from -u to -U
	because of conflicts. Thanks to C. Marquardt for finding what I do
	when I program late at night :-).

2000-08-09 04:52  zarne

	* ID3.py, jack: jack can now "update", i.e. re-generate freedb
	files (new option -u) updated ID3 module so that it supports
	ID3v1.1 track info jack now sets ID3v1.1 track info

2000-08-08 08:17  zarne
