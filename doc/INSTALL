uncompress it:
# gunzip jack-*.gz
untar it:
# tar xvf jack-*.tar
change dir:
# cd jack-*
[You are here :] Copy it somewhere in your $PATH, e.g.:
# cp jack* $HOME/bin
or (you may have to be root)
# cp jack* /usr/local/bin

install the ID3 module as it is not yet part of python:
as root:
# cp ID3.py /usr/lib/python1.5
or
# cp ID3.py /usr/local/lib/python1.5

as a normal user:
# cp ID3.py $HOME/bin
# PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
# export PATH

If you want to use the curses mode (belive me, you want to), you have to
install a special cursesmodule. The one which comes with python has no support
for pads.  The improved version from Oliver Andrich is missing the function
resizeterm which I patched in. I mailed the patch to the author so it may be
included in a future version. Get my version on the download page or download
the original cursesmodule from
http://andrich.net/python/selfmade.html#ncursesmodule
and use the patch in this directory (cursesmodule-1.5b2.patch). You can either
compile the module yourself or use the precompiled version which is in my
package. I compiled it on a RedHat 6.0 alike system on an i686. If you want to
(or have to) compile it yourself, try the following if you can't get the
Makefile to work:

# gcc  -g -O2 -I/usr/local/include/python1.5 -I/usr/local/lib/python1.5/config \
# -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -c ./cursesmodule.c
# gcc -shared  cursesmodule.o  -lncurses -ltermcap -o cursesmodule.so

Install the cursesmodule.so like you installed the ID3.py module above.

If you can't get the precompiled cursesmodule to run, make sure that all
needed libraries are installed on you system. Check this with
# ldd cursesmodule.so
which should produce output similar to
        libncurses.so.4 => /usr/lib/libncurses.so.4 (0x40018000)
        libtermcap.so.2 => /lib/libtermcap.so.2 (0x4005a000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4005e000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x80000000).
All links must be satisfied; if a library cannot be found, ldd will tell you.
In this case install all missing libraries. Some Linux systems don't install
termcap libraries, fix this; e.g. on RedHat systems, you need
libtermcap-*.rpm.

That's it!
